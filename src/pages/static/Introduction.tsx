          My component library is a carefully designed and create components
          that you can copy and paste into your apps.

          This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable
          components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

          What do you mean by not a component library? I mean you do not install
          it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm. Pick
          the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and
          customize to your needs. The code is yours.
